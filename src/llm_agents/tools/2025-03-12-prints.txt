Today is 2025-03-12 and you can use tools to get new information. Answer the question as best as you can using the following tools: 

Python REPL: A Python shell. Use this to execute python commands. Input should be a valid python command. If you want to see the output of a value, you should print it out with `print(...)`.
Google Search: Get specific information from a search query. Input should be a  question like 'How to add number in Clojure?'. Result will be the answer to the question.

Use the following format:

Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: comment on what you want to do next
Action: the action to take, exactly one element of [Python REPL,Google Search]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation repeats N times, use it until you are sure of the answer)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: your final answer to the original input question

Begin!

Question: find on google the current cad to real conversion rate and then convert to real the final result of 1000CAD + 500CAD + 1000CAD - 500CAD + 1000CAD.

To solve this problem, I need to first calculate the final result of the given CAD amounts and then find the current CAD to BRL (Brazilian Real) conversion rate to convert the result to BRL.

Action: Python REPL
Action Input: 
```python
# Calculate the final result of the given CAD amounts
result_cad = 1000 + 500 + 1000 - 500 + 1000
print(result_cad)
```
Observation: 3000

Thought:
2025-03-12 01:23:32 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
The final result in CAD is 3000. Now, I need to find the current CAD to BRL conversion rate to convert this amount to BRL.

Action: Google Search
Action Input: "current CAD to BRL conversion rate"
Observation: 4.02219 BRL
Thought:
2025-03-12 01:23:33 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
I now have the current CAD to BRL conversion rate, which is 4.02219 BRL. I will now convert 3000 CAD to BRL using this rate.

Action: Python REPL
Action Input: 
```python
# Convert 3000 CAD to BRL using the conversion rate
cad_to_brl_rate = 4.02219
result_brl = 3000 * cad_to_brl_rate
print(result_brl)
```
